# Home Prediction with Regression Technique

---

Welcome to the **Home Prediction with Regression Technique** project! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive guide and practical implementation of regression techniques, tailored for beginners who are stepping into the competitive world of data science. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking to refine your skills, this project offers a hands-on approach to understanding and applying regression models in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to predict home prices using advanced regression techniques. We leverage the **RandomForest** algorithm, known for its robustness and accuracy in handling complex datasets. To enhance the model's performance, we implement **hyperparameter tuning** using two powerful optimization methods: **Randomized Search CV** and **Bayesian Optimizer**.

### Key Features

- **RandomForest Algorithm**: Utilizes ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Employs Randomized Search CV for efficient exploration of hyperparameter space and Bayesian Optimizer for more precise tuning.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions make it accessible for those new to data science.
- **Competitive Edge**: Designed to help you understand and apply techniques commonly used in data science competitions.
